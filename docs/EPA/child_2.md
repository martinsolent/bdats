**Synoptic Project Report & Presentation Assessor Overview**

BSc Digital and Technology Solutions Professional 
Apprenticeship Standard: [ST0119 v1.1 (2015)](https://skillsengland.education.gov.uk/apprenticeships/st0119-v1-1)

The Synoptic Project is undertaken during the final six months of the apprenticeship. Apprentices are required to complete and document a work-based project, supported by their employer and Solent University tutors.

A 10,000-word report must be submitted using a standard template. Within this report, apprentices are expected to demonstrate how they have met the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours (KSBs) required for the assessment. Evidence of this should be included both in the main body of the report and in a mapping table located in the appendices.

Apprentices on the Digital and Technology Solutions apprenticeship will also complete a mapping matrix that outlines learning across all credited modules, including assessed work-based learning. This matrix (not directly assessed) provides assurance that the apprentice has achieved broad coverage of the KSBs defined in the apprenticeship standard.

The assessment structure for the synoptic project under the legacy version of the Digital & Technology Solutions Degree Apprenticeship. Unlike newer standards that rely solely on independent assessors to conduct and grade the End Point Assessment (EPA) Assessment, this version involves a collaborative assessment model with university module assessor/s, employer input and external examiner processes.

Evidence of Competency
The Synoptic Project is designed to demonstrate full coverage of the Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs).

Evidence is drawn from:

* The main body of the report
* The appendix KSB mapping
* The KSB mapping portfolio, which documents learning throughout the apprenticeship

The EPA presentation serves as a capstone validation of the apprentice’s competencies, supported by their submitted work.

**SKILLS ENGLAND GOV, 2015.** DIGITAL INDUSTRIES -ASSESSMENT PLAN DIGITAL & TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS PROFESSIONAL BSC (Hons) Digital & Technology Solutions
 [viewed 14 September 2025]. Available from: [https://skillsengland.education.gov.uk/media/1073/digital_and_technology_solutions_professional.pdf](https://skillsengland.education.gov.uk/media/1073/digital_and_technology_solutions_professional.pdf)


The Synoptic Project is assessed through a structured discussion involving:

* The apprentice
* Their university lecturer(s)
* Their employer

This discussion focuses on:

* What the apprentice has done
* he standard of their work
* *How they have done it

(As outlined in the official assessment plan: Assessment Plan – DTS)


 ![](../info/EPA_1-1_Assessor_Train_25/talk.jpg)

**Role of the Independent Assessor**
An independent assessor will be introduced to strengthen the integrity and consistency of grading. This assessor:

* Will not have taught or worked with the apprentice previously.
* Independent Assessor can be from within the institution but will act independently.
* Will serve as a second marker, applying university guidelines for 40-credit modules.
* Will collaborate with the employer and support tutor to agree the final grade and feedback.

**Assessment Process**

- The Independent Assessor will already have received the apprentice’s report and slide deck.

- They will have read the report, worked out provisional grading and feedback based on the assessment rubrics, and drafted some initial questions using the question bank.

- The Solent support tutor will also have read the report and worked out provisional grading and feedback.

- Assessors will check portfolio mapping matrix for good coverage of KSB's throughout the apprenticeship. This is not directly assessed but will be signed off on EPA feedback form.

- The assessment will take place online and will last for one hour (plus 10%).

- Presentation will need to be recorded for moderation

- Apprentices will deliver a 25–30-minute presentation on their Synoptic Project.

- This will be followed by a 25–30-minute structured interview, led by the Independent Assessor, who will ask 4–6 questions with appropriate follow-ups.

- There will also be an opportunity for the employer to summarise the apprentice’s performance on the project, based on the reference included in the report.

- The apprentice will then leave the meeting. The Independent Assessor, Solent tutor, and employer will discuss and agree to the final grade and complete feedback.

- **DON’T NOT RELEASE** **Grades & feedback** until the degree average grade has been calculated.

**Guidance for Assessors – Use of Question Bank**  

[Download DTS EPA Question Bank](../info/EPA_1-1_Assessor_Train_25/DTS_EPA_1-1_Q-Bank.pdf)

The question bank is provided as a starting point for independent assessors conducting the End Point Assessment (EPA) for the BSc (Hons) Digital & Technology Solutions Professional (integrated degree). The questions listed under each criterion are illustrative examples only. They are designed to reflect the types of knowledge, skills, and behaviours (KSBs) outlined in the apprenticeship standard and are generic in nature.  

Apprentices will be coming from different occupational pathways and will have different synoptic project focuses. Assessors will conduct a 25–30-minute interview, asking between 4–6 questions with appropriate follow-up questions. This interview follows the apprentice’s 25–30-minute presentation.  

The Synoptic Project submitted by the apprentice is designed to demonstrate full coverage of the core KSBs, both within the body of the report and the appendix project KSB mapping. In addition, apprentices will have submitted a comprehensive KSB mapping portfolio that evidence learning throughout the apprenticeship on all their credited modules. This ensures that the apprentice has achieved complete KSB coverage and provides a clear link between their work and the EPA assessment. The EPA interview is a capstone assessment to validate their competencies with reference to the submitted work.  

**Note:** These questions are not tailored to any specific specialism, apprentice’s project report or presentation. Instead, they serve as a foundation to help assessors craft contextualised and relevant questions that align with the actual content of the apprentice’s submitted work and presentation.  

**Assessors are encouraged to:**

- Use these examples to inspire and structure their own questions.

- Adapt the phrasing and focus based on the apprentice’s specialism, project scope, and organisational context.

- Ensure that the final questions used during the EPA interview are directly linked to the apprentice’s demonstrated work and mapped learning outcomes.

- Use them in conjunction with grade mark rubrics for the Synoptic Project EPA


**Guidance for Assessors – Giving written feedback**

**Written feedback plays a vital role in the End-Point Assessment (EPA) process** It should be clear, constructive and aligned with the assessment criteria. The aim is to provide apprentices with a fair and transparent summary of their performance, while also supporting quality assurance and moderation.

**Best Practice for Written Feedback:**

- **Be specific and evidence-based:** Feedback should refer directly to the apprentice’s work, using examples where possible. Avoid vague statements and focus on what was done well or where improvement is needed.

- **Link to the grading criteria**: Clearly explain how the apprentice has met (or not met) the requirements of the standard. Use the language of the grading descriptors to support consistency and clarity.

- **Balance strengths and areas for development**: Highlight what the apprentice did well, as well as areas that could be improved. This helps ensure feedback is balanced and developmental.

- **Use accessible language**: Avoid jargon or overly technical terms unless they are relevant to the assessment. The feedback should be easy to understand for the apprentice and other stakeholders.

- **Be comprehensive but concise**: Feedback should cover all relevant aspects of the assessment, including technical knowledge, skills, behaviours and professional practice. However, it should remain focused and avoid unnecessary repetition.

- **Maintain a professional tone**: Feedback should be respectful, impartial and supportive. It should reflect the seriousness of the EPA process and the importance of the apprentice’s achievement.

- **Support moderation and audit**: Ensure feedback is detailed enough to support internal and external quality assurance. It should justify the grade awarded and be consistent with the evidence presented.

There is a blank feedback sheet titled [BLANK_EPA_1-1_FEEDBACK](../info/EPA_1-1_Assessor_Train_25/BLANK_EPA_1-1_FEEDBACK_2025_v4.docx), and a partially populated sheet called [RESPONSE_EPA_1-1_FEEDBACK](../info/EPA_1-1_Assessor_Train_25/Response_EPA_1-1_FEEDBACK_2024_v4.pdf). The latter includes example responses from the apprentice, based on questions from the question bank and the grade mark criteria. You will also use the Excel grade calculator to come up with an overall average numeric value.

**Guidance for Assessors - Grading the Assessment**

The Synoptic Project module is a credited part of the Digital and Technology Solutions degree. Apprentices must pass this module to complete the degree and they must pass the degree to complete the apprenticeship.

**Final Assessment and Grading**  


All apprentices will be studying for a BSc Honours degree in Digital & Technology Solutions. It is the achievement of the Honours degree that demonstrates that the standard has been met, and which provides the grading.

**The grading of the degree award is significantly made up of the synoptic project assessment together with module assessments.** The Honours degree award and classification is based on a weighted average mark of the assessed work the apprentice has completed. The synoptic project contributes greatly to the final year marks. The final year overall contributes to the grading typically in the ratio of 3 – 5 times that of second year modules (based on a three-year model). The synoptic project must be passed in all cases to achieve the degree award.

Apprentices will be graded using Honours degree classifications for English universities. All UK universities must follow the QAA (Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education) Code of practice for the assurance of academic quality and standards in higher education. This ensures continued consistency across universities.

**The national degree award outcomes are shown below with apprenticeship grading equivalence. These typically are as follows:**  


 ![](../info/EPA_1-1_Assessor_Train_25/table_grade.png)

At Solent University, assessments are marked using a numeric grading system. Individual assessments use “stepped” grading, as shown below:

**Solent Numeric Grading**

 ![](../info/EPA_1-1_Assessor_Train_25/grade.png)

**Solent Grading Criteria**

</div>


This grade calculator is designed to support assessors in evaluating apprentices’ performance in the **Synoptic Project EPA**. It calculates an overall numeric grade and maps it to a classification:

[The spreadsheet includes a structured list of learning outcomes across three domains:](../info/EPA_1-1_Assessor_Train_25/EPA_1-1_Assessor_GRADER_CAL_Sept_25.xlsx)

- **Core Skills (CS)**

- **Core Technical Knowledge (CTK)**

- **Core Behavioural Skills (CBS)**


Each outcome has a dropdown menu where assessors can select a grade.  

![](../info/EPA_1-1_Assessor_Train_25/drop.png)

Assessors are not expected to grade every single learning outcome. The criteria assessed should reflect the **nature and scope of the project presented**, but there should be **good coverage across Skills, Knowledge, and Behaviours** to ensure a balanced evaluation.

**Formula Logic**

The calculator uses conditional formulas **like =IF(G1="", "", ...)** to ensure that calculations only occur when a grade is entered. This prevents errors and ensures that blank cells are ignored.

Once grades are entered:

- The calculator **averages only the numeric values** of the assessed criteria.

- It then **maps the average** to a classification using the Grade Criteria Guidance.

**Grade Criteria Guidance**

**The numeric value for this module will contribute to the overall grade average for the final degree and apprenticeship classifications, in line with Southampton Solent’s grading regulations, to determine the final Apprenticeship degree classification. This might take up to 2 weeks to be confirmed.**

**You will be given an Excel grade calculator to use to help you calculate the overall grade.**

**Purpose:**

This grade calculator supports the assessment of apprentices' **Synoptic Project EPA for the BSc Digital & Technology Solutions Degree Apprenticeship**. It calculates an overall numeric **grade and classification (Distinction, Merit, Pass, or Fail).**

**Key Principles:**

- **Not all learning outcomes need to be assessed**

- The criteria assessed should reflect the nature and scope of the project presented

- There must **be good coverage across the Skills, Knowledge, and Behaviours sections**

- The calculator averages only the criteria that have been assessed. Blank cells are ignored.

**How It Works:**

- Each learning outcome **(e.g., CS1, CTK3, CBS5)** has a dropdown for selecting a grade.

- Grades are mapped to numeric **values (e.g., Distinction = 10, Merit = 8-9, Pass = 6-7, etc.)**

- The calculator uses Excel logic to average only filled-in grades.

- The final numeric average is matched to a classification using the guidance table.

**Why this is Fair:**

- Apprentices are not penalised for outcomes that were not assessed.

- The average reflects only the evidence presented.

- This supports flexibility and consistency across different project types.

**Assessor Checklist:**

- Assess criteria relevant to the project

- Ensure coverage across Skills, Knowledge, and Behaviours **- Apprentices will map their work to KSBs in an Appendix in their report**

- Use the dropdowns to select grades.

- Leave unassessed outcomes blank.

- Review the final grade and classification generated.

**Benefits of the Calculator**

- Enables **consistent assessment** across all KSBs.

- Ensures **transparency** in grading.

- Aligns feedback with **numeric scores**.

- Supports **moderation and standardisation** across assessors.
