# Routing & Switching COM414

### Why is this module important?

As enterprises migrate toward controller-based architectures, the role and skills required of a core network engineer are evolving and more vital than ever. To prepare for this network transition the module will not only prepare you with the knowledge of foundational technologies, but ensure you stay relevant with skill sets needed for the adoption of next generation technologies.

### What you will learn on the module

We will start with connecting together real network equipment in the advanced network lab. You will install and configure network components, including switches and routers and firewalls. You will apply structured approaches to troubleshooting network issues in hardware, software products and the network services. You will communicate effectively with colleagues in your cohort while building the networks in teams. 

You will apply diagnostic tools and techniques to identify the causes of network performance issues developing analytical skills and understand and apply the maths required to be a network engineer. You will gain knowledge of static and dynamic routing protocols and switching concepts by studying online reading and interactive materials. 

You will practice implementing, verifying, and troubleshooting routing operations using static and dynamic routing .You will perform LAN design tasks and switch configuration to understand virtual LANs and how to interconnect them and route between them.

### What you will be able to do after the module

1.	Design install and configure a medium complexity computer network using routers and switches and associated network protocols. 
2.	Define the characteristics of LAN / VLAN / Routing protocols methods and technologies
3.	Use analytical and problem-solving skills to design implement simulate test and troubleshoot computer networks 
4.	Plan with a thorough and organised approach how you are going to implement a working solution in a limited time.
