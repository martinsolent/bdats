# Portfolio

You are required to map your learning to the Knowledge, Skills & Behaviours (KSBs) outlined in the DATS Standard through **Portfolio Mapping.**

This process involves mapping the work you completed during your university modules, including work-based modules, you can also map tasks undertaken in your job role with your employer.


**Your university modules have already been uploaded to our system, graded, internally and externally moderated, and signed off at the Assessment and Progression Boards. You only need to create an overarching document that summarises each item in your portfolio and maps them to the relevant KSBs for your specialism (pathway) using the Portfolio template and KSBs Matrix.**


You will be offered support and guidance in the final Synoptic Project Module COM625 and in following the Gateway EPA period.
