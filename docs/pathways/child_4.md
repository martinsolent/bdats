A Software Engineer needs to be able to design, develop, build and test high-quality software solutions. This role requires apprentices to apply engineering principles at all levels of the software development process. This includes requirement gathering, analysis and design, development and data requirements, while ensuring security robustness is built in. Software engineers typically work as part of a larger collaborative team and will have responsibility for significant elements of software projects.
