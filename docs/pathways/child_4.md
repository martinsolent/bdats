Software engineers typically work as part of a larger collaborative team and will have responsibility for significant elements of software projects.

### Skills 

**Be able to:**

* Create effective and secure software solutions using contemporary software development languages to deliver the full range of functional and non-functional requirements using relevant development methodologies.
* Undertake analysis and design to create artefacts, such as use cases to produce robust software designs.
* Produce high quality code with sound syntax in at least one language following best practices and standards.
* Perform code reviews, debugging and refactoring to improve code quality and efficiency.
* Test code to ensure that the functional and non-functional requirements have been met.
* Deliver software solutions using industry standard build processes, and tools for configuration management, version control and software build, release and deployment into enterprise environments.

### Technical Knowledge

**Knows and understands:**

* How to operate at all stages of the software development lifecycle.
* How teams work effectively to develop software solutions embracing agile and other development approaches.
* How to apply software analysis and design approaches.
* How to interpret and implement a design, compliant with functional, non-functional and security requirements.
* How to perform functional and unit testing.
* How to use and apply the range of software tools used in Software engineering.
