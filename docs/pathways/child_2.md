The role of a data analyst is to collect, organise and study data that can provide new business insight. This data is then compiled and used to inform decision making at all levels of the business. A data analyst is involved with managing, cleansing, abstracting and aggregate data across the network infrastructure. They also have a good understanding of data structures, software development procedures and the tools used to undertake standard and custom analytical studies, providing data solutions to a range of business issues.
