Welcome to this morning's webinar. We are scheduled to start at 10:00 am. A copy of the slides will be sent after the webinar.

Audience Question
Q: Emma - How much of an apprenticeship can be recognised as Prior Learning? For example if someone has already undertaken some Level 7 modules that also form part of a MSc apprenticeship route how many credits can a HEI APEL toward the MSc Apprenticeship?
A: The number of credits/units etc that can be APL is not mandated. However, the requirement for minimum 12 months and 20% off the job is clear. If the amount you are putting through APL is large enough to bring the required duration below 12 months or cannot hit the required 20% the apprenticeship is ineligible.

Audience Question
Q: Interested to know how we are able to take into account the fact that GCSE/A Levels were tutor graded during Covid and we have found there are large knowledge gaps. However we have the issue that an A Level in Accounting would mean the ESFA would say this is RPL for a Level 3 Apprenticeship however Apprentices then struggle as they do not have the knowledge or experience to be able to cope at Level 3 and would have been better suited to a Level 2. How do we overcome this?
A: Discussed on live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: So many of our competitors just charge the funding cap regardless of RPL -I do not understand how they are able to acheive this?
A: Discussed on live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: Hello - apologies if this may be covered later on but I thought I would ask now - one of our learners has an EHCP and significant educational needs. In order to become compenent, he is having to repeat certain elements of OJT - obviously once learners are competent, we dont count OJT "twice" but for this individual, the circumstances are different. Can we count the repeated OJT until competence (and confidence) is achieved? Thank you
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: If for example we deliver a three hour tutored session but it covers a range of different KSBS. And a learner has prior knowledge in a small sector of that tutored session, as it doesnt change how the tutored session will be delivered, should it still be discounted. Our delivery still takes place as it is planned to cover a range of thinga so it isnt something that we simply do not deliver. We have regular monthly group sessions
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: Some learners will have some knowledge, but not enough that they could be exempt from a module - they would therefore cost as much to deliver to as one who had no knowledge. This is obviously a challenge to providers trying to calculate cost of delivery
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: if a programme requires 2115 off job to achieve but the 20% is 556 which figure do you use?
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: can we have a recording of this session ?
A: Yes, a link to the recording will be sent out later.

Audience Question
Q: When calculating 20% OTJ should we deduct lunches from contracted hours
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: How would we calculate OTJ hours for those apprentices working in schools who are only contracted for 39 weeks a year (term time contract)?
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: Do all apprenticeships have to do minimum of 372 days regardless of what level apprenticeship they do?
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: A question for Lisa please - Can mock assessments be included as OTJ?
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: What proportion of OTJT should be delivered by the training provider? Is there a minimum?? (lisa?)
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: If the learners spend time whilst they are in college doing write ups of what they have done OTJ at work can this count towards the hours?
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: Lisa just considering your point just made regarding subcontracting training. If the employer for example is a GP surgery with a Trainee Nurse Assistant and they are actually teaching some of the clinical skills required for the apprenticeship would this be regarded as a subcontracting issue?
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: on the apprenticeship agreement and the commitment statement
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: In your opinion, who is best placed to undertake the assessment of the learners RPL? Would this be someone that 'teaches' the standard? Or would you expect someone who administrates apprenticeships to be able to undertake this effectively? (Susannah?)
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: Do you have examples of what good looks like in logging off the job hours
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: What constitues 'sufficient detail' for recording OTJT?
A: Discussed on the live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: Please can you advise what type of evidence will need to be provided for Off the Job where an apprentice has transferred from another training provider to finish off their apprenticeship.
A: Discussed on live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: if a learners plan details that the OTJ only starts for lets say after 6 months or is mainly done towards the end of the programee but they come off early would this be an issue
A: Discussed on live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: What about where an apprentice leaves early? May not always have met the 20%?
A: Discussed on live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: Do you have examples of what differentiates learning to perform in role vs learning required for Off the job
A: Discussed on live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: if an apprentice moves to a new employer first employer 30hours we record planned hours on ILR. The apprentice starts within 30days with 2nd Employer and their work hours is 40 do we amend the Planned Hours on ILR as it would have been previously based on 30 hours?
A: Discussed on live webinar.

Audience Question
Q: Is revision included in OTJ hours?
A: Discussed on live webinar.
