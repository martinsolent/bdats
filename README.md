### Software Engineer

![Software Engineer](images/trello_course_structure_images_2020_0010_se.png)

A software engineer needs to be able to design, develop, build and test high-quality software solutions. This role requires apprentices to apply engineering principles at all levels of the software development process. This includes requirement gathering, analysis and design, development and data requirements, while ensuring security robustness is built in. Software engineers typically work as part of a larger collaborative team and will have responsibility for significant elements of software projects.

The primary role of a network engineer is to design, install, maintain and support communication networks within an organisation or between organisations. They need to maintain high levels of network performance and availability for users. They must also understand network configuration, cloud, network administration, and monitoring tools, and be able to give technical advice and guidance. Network engineers must be proficient in technology solutions to be able to analyse system requirements to ensure the network and its services operate to desired levels. Network engineers also understand data traffic and transmission across the network and have a major role to play in ensuring network security.

The role of a data analyst is to collect, organise and study data that can provide new business insight. This data is then compiled and used to inform decision making at all levels of the business. A data analyst is involved with managing, cleansing, abstracting and aggregate data across the network infrastructure. They also have a good understanding of data structures, software development procedures and the tools used to undertake standard and custom analytical studies, providing data solutions to a range of business issues.
